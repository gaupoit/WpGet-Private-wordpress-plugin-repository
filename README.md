# WpGet
Wordpress private repository for plugins.

## Why we need a private repository

Wordpress is the most used CMS in the world with the most important plugin system. It's easy for a developer to create and publish a new plugin into the public reposiory. But what if i had to create and mantain a private plugin? Im speaking about:

* a plugin with an high intellectual content,
* a plugin not ready for the public, maybe focused on some particular business case
* a custom super-plugin built used to inject custom plugin dependency

There are actually these opportunities into public repository:

1. Make a free plugin
2. Make a paied plugin (but placing into main repository it is available to everyone open to buy it)
3. Intall you plugin manually

Firts two option are the most widely adopted by public plugin sellers, while the third one is a very common practice into agency or companies that have some common plugin reused in many websites.

*WpGet* came to give a forth opportuninty. It is conceived as a private repository where you can push plugins and allow wordpress installation to update from that source, in addiction to the standard platform. For who comes from other technlogy *WpGet is similar to NuGet, Maven or NPM package manager*. 

Here a siple diagram to explain how WpGet works.
